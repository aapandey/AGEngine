# Attached are the .rar files of all sections of assignment 2. All sections have been implemented in a single project. Extract the project from rar file and open it using Eclipse. I have used Eclipse Oxygen for development.

# AGEngine

AGEngine
Java based game engine for building games
. AGEngine is currently being developed by Abhishek Pandey as an open-source project as part of coursework CSC 591 - Game Engine Foundations. AGEngine will provide you customizability to create any 2D platformer game with networking capabilities.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need Java SDK 1.8+, Eclipse and Processing 3.4+ in your system before you can start working on AGEngine. 

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Clone the repository
Open Eclipse and go to File -> Open Projects from File System -> Select the path where you cloned the repository -> Finish
```

And repeat

```

```

This will set up the environment for development

## Running the tests

In order to test all the functionality of Assignment 2
All Section : Run SceneManager.java and pass two arguments, "server"/"client" to create either a server or client and another as "object"/"string" to pass the gameObjects as through objects or string. This is required only when starting as server. For client, just pass two arguments first being "client" and other an integer to signify client id. 

Server needs to be created first before creating any client.
Any number of clients can then be created
