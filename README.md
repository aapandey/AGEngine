# Attached are the .rar files of all sections of Assignment 4. All sections have been implemented in a single project. Extract the project from rar file and open it using Eclipse. I have used Eclipse Oxygen for development.

# AGEngine

AGEngine
Java based game engine for building games
. AGEngine is currently being developed by Abhishek Pandey as an open-source project as part of coursework CSC 591 - Game Engine Foundations. AGEngine will provide you customizability to create any 2D platformer game with networking capabilities.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need Java SDK 1.8+, Eclipse and Processing 3.4+ in your system before you can start working on AGEngine. 

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Clone the repository
Open Eclipse and go to File -> Open Projects from File System -> Select the path where you cloned the repository -> Finish
```

And repeat

```

```

This will set up the environment for development

## Running the tests

In order to test all the functionality of Assignment 4
Section 1 Scripting : Run ScriptIntegrationExample.java in AGEngine.script package. 
Section 2 & 3: 
To run Space Invaders run SpaceController.java in AGEngine.games.invader package. No parameter required.
To run Snake run SnakeController.java in AGEngine.games.snake package. No parameter required.
