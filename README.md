# AGEngine

AGEngine
Java based game engine for building games
. AGEngine is currently being developed by Abhishek Pandey as an open-source project as part of coursework CSC 591 - Game Engine Foundations. AGEngine will provide you customizability to create any 2D platformer game with networking capabilities.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need Java SDK 1.8+, Eclipse and Processing 3.4+ in your system before you can start working on AGEngine. 

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Clone the repository
Open Eclipse and go to File -> Open Projects from File System -> Select the path where you cloned the repository -> Finish
```

And repeat

```

```

This will set up the environment for development

## Running the tests

In order to test all the functionality of Assignment 1
Section 1 - Compile AGEngine.core.MainGameLoop.java then run the AGEngine.core.MainGameLoop using eclipse(no parameters required)

Section 2 and 3 - Compile and run the AGEngine.network.SampleServer.java(no arguments required) and then run AGEngine.network.SampleClient.java(1 integer argument expected). For multple clients create new instances of SampleClient.java and pass different command line integer paramters to distinguish between them

Section 4 - Compile and run the AGEngine.asynchronous.network.ServerGame.java(no arguments required) to create a server and then connect clients by running multiple instances of AGEngine.asynchronous.network.ClientGame.java(no arguments required).
